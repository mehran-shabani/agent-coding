# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Shell Injection Prevention (agent/tools/shell.py)
- **Issue**: Command execution used `shell=True` with unsanitized user input
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `shlex.split()` to safely parse commands
  - Changed to `shell=False` to prevent shell injection
  - Implemented whitelist-based command validation
  - Added comprehensive checks for command substitution, dangerous redirections, and critical path access

### 2. Path Traversal Protection (agent/tools/patch.py)
- **Issue**: Patch application could write files outside the base directory
- **Fix**:
  - Added path resolution and validation in `apply_patch_file()`
  - Prevents `../../../etc/passwd` style attacks
  - Validates all file paths are within the base directory

### 3. Import Organization (agent/tools/patch.py)
- **Issue**: Inline `import shutil` inside function
- **Fix**: Moved shutil import to module level

## Code Quality Improvements

### 4. Improved Command Safety (agent/tools/shell.py)
- Replaced blacklist approach with whitelist approach
- Added validation for:
  - Command substitution (`$()`, backticks, `${}`)
  - Dangerous redirections to `/dev/` files
  - Pipe command validation
  - Critical system path protection
- Special handling for `rm` command with `-rf` flags

### 5. Better Logging (agent/tools/shell.py)
- **Issue**: Fragile text-based log parsing
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed to JSON Lines (JSONL) format
  - Improved `get_command_history()` to parse JSON properly
  - More reliable and structured logging

### 6. Project Metadata (pyproject.toml)
- Added license declaration
- Added project URLs
- Added version constraints for all dependencies
- Added `typing-extensions` for Python < 3.9

### 7. Configuration File (/.env.example)
- Fixed key ordering as requested by dotenv-linter
- Added final newline

### 8. Documentation (README.md)
- Fixed all markdown formatting issues (MD031, MD032, MD029, MD040, MD047)
- Added security warnings for shell commands
- Added proper language specification for code blocks
- Added final newline

## Security Testing Results

All security fixes have been tested and verified:

✅ Path traversal attacks are blocked
✅ Shell injection attempts are prevented  
✅ Dangerous commands require explicit confirmation
✅ Command whitelist properly restricts execution
✅ JSON logging format works correctly
✅ CLI functionality remains intact

## Commands Now Safely Restricted

The following command patterns are now blocked or require confirmation:
- `rm -rf /` and similar destructive deletions
- Commands not in the whitelist
- Command substitution attempts
- Redirections to device files
- Access to critical system paths (`/etc`, `/usr`, `/sys`, etc.)
- Pipe operations to unauthorized commands

## Recommended Security Practices

1. Always run commands in a sandboxed environment when possible
2. Regularly review the whitelist in `is_safe_command()` 
3. Monitor command logs for suspicious activity
4. Keep dependencies updated within version constraints
5. Use the `--yes` flag sparingly and only for trusted operations
